# Guessing_Game
This is a game in which you have to guess the number the computer is thinking...
There are 3 levels - easy, medium and hard. The higher the level, the wider the range of numbers you have to guess from.
Each time you guess a number, the computer will tell you if it needs to be higher or lower.
Each guess is 1 point and the aim of the game is to have the least amount of points.
Enjoy :)
